cspace_tarball
==============

Puppet module for getting a CollectionSpace release tarball distribution and extracting it to a server instance.

**Please make changes on the appropriate branch for the CollectionSpace
version to be installed**: e.g. `v4.2`, `v4.1`. And create new branches
for new CollectionSpace versions. (The `master` branch is now deprecated.)
